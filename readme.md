First webpage designed on my own CMS (not yet named).  
## [Graphical project](https://www.figma.com/file/9MOAWdrk5MHid1iPrzpsZG/artek.com.pl)

## CMS documentation

CMS is divided into 2 sections.
Front, including main landing page, contact form, gallery.  
Dashboard focused to allow administrator to dynamically manage website contents.  
**For example:**
- managing gallery photos

- managing contact data

**Pros of my CMS:**
- easy to use even for people not familiar with technology
- highly configurable
- easy access to write own scripts and stylesheets
